I woke up at 5.15am with an inspiration on how to display the results of the survey INCLUDING the images. Yesterday I had only compiled the results into a list `<li>` - I thought about adding them as bullet-images in CSS. I couldn`t figure that out but it led me to go back to basics. Just looking over my code on how we had displayed the random images in class. And then translate that to the results images. And it worked.

Then I continued on to implement the solution I observed TA Chance Harmon give to Matt Simms yesterday. Displaying content with the CSS property of display: none. And then changing that dynamically in JS through a button. define a variable that grabs onto the `id=buttonShow` and then `buttonShow.addEventListener` on the button. And in the function simply set the `buttonShow.style.display='block'`

I LOVE THAT. Having a new idea and following it. Until it all works out. Beautiful.
